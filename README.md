## COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE OVERVIEW

* From the perspective of public and private investors, **Real Estate** is typically segmented across **Residential** and **Commercial** verticals.
* Unique sectors within each vertical are valued distinctly from one another. 
* Analysis evaluates the commercial RE sectors outlined below:

* COMMERCIAL
  * Retail - Strip Centers / NNN Retail / Malls
  * Multifamily - Apartments
  * Office - Central Business District (CBD) / Suburban
  * Hospitality - Full-Service Hotels / Limited-Service Hotels
  * Self-Storage - Individual / Commercial
  * Industrial - Warehouse / Logistics

* RESIDENTIAL
  * Single-Family Homes
  * Condo / Townhome / Duplex
  * Manufactured Housing 

* While many different valuation tools for residential real estate investors or homebuyers are readily available online (Zillow.com, Homesnap.com, Redfin.com), very few CRE parallels (even fewer without exorbitant fees) have emerged publicly, outside of applications offered by CoStar Group (LoopNet.com, TenX.com).

* Comprehensive CRE transaction data is often difficult to attain. Public transaction records or financing documents tend to offer limited information, due to marginal reporting requirements as it pertains to property operations. Only a handful of sources provide reliable CRE transaction data, often protected behind lofty subscription paywalls.
  * Enables an unfair advantage for larger, well-capitalized institutional investors, while smaller investors are forced to either contract a broker, assume costs for subscription services, or move forward with incomplete data.
